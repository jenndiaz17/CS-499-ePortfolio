# **CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio**

This repository contains my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio for Southern New Hampshire University.
It represents the culmination of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and highlights my technical growth in software engineering, algorithms & data structures, databases, testing, and security.

## ** Overview**

This ePortfolio was developed to showcase my ability to design, implement, and enhance software solutions while following industry best practices.
Each artifact within this portfolio has been enhanced from its original form to demonstrate:

Improved functionality and performance

Secure coding practices

Maintainable and well-documented code

Alignment with professional software development standards

## **Contents**

Self-Assessment – Reflection on my academic journey, skills gained, and readiness for the software development industry.

Code Review – A guided walkthrough of my enhanced CS-330 OpenGL 3D Scene project, detailing changes, challenges, and outcomes.

Artifacts – Three enhanced projects from my coursework:

1. Software Design & Engineering (CS-330 OpenGL)
Enhancements: Added realistic Phong lighting, texture mapping with stb_image.h, and reorganized scene management.

Skills Demonstrated: Object-oriented design, rendering pipelines, shader programming, maintainable architecture.

Outcome: More realistic graphics and a modular codebase that’s easier to expand.

2. Algorithms & Data Structures / Testing (CS-320)
Enhancements: Expanded automated testing with negative test cases, data-driven inputs, and better test organization.

Skills Demonstrated: Test-driven development (TDD), parameterized testing, edge case handling.

Outcome: Higher test coverage, improved detection of defects, and easier test maintenance.

3. Databases (CS-465 Travlr API)
Enhancements: Strengthened Mongoose schema validation, implemented secure input handling, and improved code documentation.

Skills Demonstrated: Backend development, MongoDB schema design, validation, security best practices.

Outcome: Reliable, secure, and maintainable database integration with a production-ready API.

# **Skills & Competencies Demonstrated**
Software Engineering: Modular design, maintainability, scalability.

Algorithms & Data Structures: Efficient problem-solving, structured logic.

Database Management: Secure schema design, data validation.

Testing & Quality Assurance: TDD, automated test suites, edge case analysis.

Security Practices: Input validation, secure coding, error handling.

Professional Communication: Clear documentation, version control, and presentation of technical work.
